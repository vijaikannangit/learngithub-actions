It serves two purposes:

The Python interpreter recognizes a folder as the package if it contains __init__.py file.
__init__.py exposes specified resources from its modules to be imported.
An empty __init__.py file makes all functions from the above modules available when this package is imported. Note that __init__.py is essential for the folder to be recognized by Python as a package. You can optionally define functions from individual modules to be made available.
